The provided code defines a ROS2 node that merges maps from three robots. It uses transformations to align the maps in a global coordinate frame and then merges them by averaging their occupancy grid data. Let's go through the main parts of the code to clarify what each section does.

Map Subscription: Three subscribers are created, one for each robot's map (/robot1/map, /robot2/map, /robot3/map).
TF Listener: A TF listener is created to listen for transforms that will allow us to align the maps in the global frame.
Map Publisher: A publisher is initialized for publishing the merged map (/merged_map).

When a new map message arrives, the callback tries to obtain the transform from the map's frame to the global frame using lookup_transform.
The map is then transformed to the global frame by calling transform_map, and after that, it is merged using merge_map.

Transformation Logic: This function transforms the map from the local coordinate system to the global coordinate system.
It converts the grid coordinates (i, j) of the map to world coordinates (x, y).
Then it applies the transformation using apply_transform_to_coordinates.
After transforming the world coordinates to global coordinates, it converts them back into map grid coordinates and updates the occupancy grid at those coordinates.

Map Merging Logic: This function merges the occupancy grids from multiple robots.
The first time the function is called, it initializes self.merged_map with the first map.
For each cell in the map (map_msg.data[i]), if the cell is not unknown (i.e., not -1), it either copies the data or averages it with the corresponding cell in the merged map. This allows combining multiple maps from different robots into one.
The merged map is then published to the /merged_map topic.
